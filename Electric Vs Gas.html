		<h1> Electric Vs Gas </h1> <!-- *Into* -->
		<p> The future is near, and so is carbon emissions. 
			With CO2 Levels on the rise, countries have now decided to use gas vehicles to be banned in a few years. 
			Car manufacturers are looking for electricity, though there may be better options than electricity.
		</p>
		<!-- Sub Sections of main idea (Electric Vs Gas)-->
		<h2> Differences </h2>
			<p> Gas and electric vehicles are two different things. 
				Gas is either gasoline or diesel; the difference is that one burns better than the other. 
				Electric vehicles are either fully electric or hybrid. 
				Hybrid combines gasoline and electrical components, whereas full electric is fully electric. 
				Gas vehicles tend to be more accessible; if I needed gas compared to electricity, 
				I would need to go to a gas station rather than drive farther to a charging station.
				Electric vehicles have longer mileage on a full charge than gas.
			</p>

		<h2> Similarities</h2>
			<p> Both types of vehicles get you to your destination. 
				Both cars would also need maintenance at specific points in time.
			</p>
		<h2> Money/Long Term Maintenance</h2>
			<p> Electric vehicles are expensive upfront but require less maintenance (oil changes). 
				Gas vehicles are cheaper initially, though you must pay for maintenance and keep up on service records. 
				Most people forget that the only difference between an 
				electric vehicle and a gas vehicle is that one does not have an engine; 
				that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the vehicle would not need maintenance; it still does. 
				Electric vehicles still have significant components that wear, just like gas vehicles, so the only upside is no more oil changes.

			<p> These car companies manufacture electric vehicles on a wide scale. 
				Usually, electric vehicles take months! 
				Think about Toyota making a gas car in a week; that&rsquo;s 
				how long these car companies also take to manufacture an electric vehicle.
