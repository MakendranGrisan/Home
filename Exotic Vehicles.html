			<p> There are many types of exotic vehicles. 
				What makes them different from the cars you 
				would see on the road is that they could have a unique 
				engine and can be a design that looks too &ldquo;weird&rdquo; to be true.
			</p>
			<p> Exotic Vehicles are typically found to be manufactured within the country 
				where it was designed, unlike Toyota, where we create vehicles here (Canada) and get 
				them manufactured (most of the time) in Japan. There are many makes and models, 
				though we will go through some of the more &ldquo;popular&rdquo; types of exotic cars.
